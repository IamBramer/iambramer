description: "Delicious jams made with local ingredients in North Wisconsin is the base of this project. Anne is a friend of a coworker I had and she had just started her own jam making business called <em><strong>Just North of Jam</strong></em>. She was looking to have a visual identity package to launch with and my coworker sent her to me!"
description-two: "The idea was to keep it simple and clean with a hint of Northern Wisconsin woods. Alongside the logo design I wanted to give her some graphical elements that she could carry throughout the brand, which transformed into the geometric arrows."
