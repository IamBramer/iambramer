description: "Nick Fiori is a very good friend of mine, so when he said he needed some good portraits done for his Linkedin profile we went all out. This was a great chance for me to test out some new lighting techniques I wanted to try and a great chance for him to get some awesome new shots."
description-two: "The setups were fairly simply and really low end. I had two strobes, a black blanket, and a reflector to work with in my small apartment space. Needless to say, I think we got some really awesome shots."
